    shortDescription: 'Upstream delivers what downstream needs',
    detailedDescription:
      'The upstream team (supplier) provides data or services that the downstream team (customer) depends on. The upstream team should consider downstream needs when planning, but ultimately controls the delivery schedule and model. Note: "upstream/downstream" refers to control over the integration, not data flow direction—data can flow either way.',

      'Upstream team is willing to accommodate downstream requests',
      'Downstream has some negotiating power over priorities',

    shortDescription: 'Downstream adopts upstream model as-is',
    detailedDescription:
      'The downstream team fully adopts the upstream model without translation. This is appropriate when the upstream model is good enough and the cost of translation outweighs the benefits. The downstream team has no influence over the upstream model.',
    whenToUse: [
      'Upstream model is well-designed and fits downstream needs',
      'Upstream team has no capacity to accommodate downstream',
      'Cost of maintaining a translation layer is too high',
      'Integrating with a dominant external system or standard',

    detailedDescription:
      'The downstream team creates a translation layer to isolate their model from the upstream model. This prevents upstream concepts from "corrupting" the downstream domain model. The ACL translates between the two models.',
    whenToUse: [
      "Upstream model is legacy, poorly designed, or doesn't fit your domain",
      "You need to protect your model's integrity",
      "Integrating with external systems you don't control",

      'Multiple downstream contexts need the same data/services',
      'You want to decouple from individual consumer needs',
      'Building a platform or shared service',

    shortDescription: 'Teams share a subset of the model',
    detailedDescription:
      'Two or more teams share a common subset of the domain model (code, database schema, or both). Changes to the shared kernel require coordination between all teams. This creates tight coupling but reduces duplication.',

      'Core domain concepts are truly shared between contexts',
      'Teams can commit to coordinated changes',
      'Duplication would be more costly than coordination',

    shortDescription: 'Teams succeed or fail together',

    powerDynamics: 'none',
    category: 'autonomous',
    shortDescription: 'No integration between contexts',
    detailedDescription:
      'A deliberate decision not to integrate two contexts. Each context solves its own problems independently, even if this means some duplication. This eliminates integration complexity and allows full autonomy.',
    whenToUse: [
      'Integration cost exceeds the benefit',
      'Contexts have very different lifecycles or priorities',
      'Duplication is acceptable for the use case',
      'Teams need maximum autonomy',

      'Marketing and Warehouse contexts both maintain their own product descriptions rather than integrating, because their needs are different enough that integration adds more complexity than value.',
