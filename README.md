**Map reality, not aspiration.**

ContextFlow is a visual DDD context mapper for analyzing bounded contexts, their relationships, and code ownership across three complementary views guiding you through strategic domain analysis: **Value Stream** (context mapping), **Distillation** (domain classification), and **Strategic** (Wardley mapping).

## What is ContextFlow?

ContextFlow helps teams map and edit their system architecture as it actually exists — not as the slide deck says it should be. It captures:

- **Bounded contexts** with strategic classification (core/supporting/generic), boundary integrity (strong/moderate/weak), and visual properties
- **DDD relationship patterns** between contexts (customer-supplier, conformist, anti-corruption layer, open-host service, shared kernel, partnership, etc.)
- **Wardley Map value chain** with actors, user needs, and contexts showing complete problem-to-solution flow
- **Code ownership** linking repositories to contexts and teams via drag-and-drop
- **Team topology** connecting teams to their boards and responsibilities
- **Capability groups** as organic blob-shaped visual clusters using Catmull-Rom smoothing
- **Temporal evolution** showing how your architecture changes over time with keyframes and timeline playback

The key differentiator: **three models of your sociotechnical system**.

### Value Stream View
**Context mapping**: Shows how value and data move left-to-right through your system. Map bounded contexts and visualize how work flows between them. Stages are configurable per project (e.g., "Discovery → Selection → Purchase → Fulfillment → Post-Sale" for e-commerce, or "Ingest → Normalize → Analyze → Publish" for data pipelines).

![Value Stream View](docs/context-flow-1.png)

### Distillation View
**Domain classification**: Classify bounded contexts using Nick Tune's Core Domain Chart. Position contexts by Business Differentiation (Y-axis) and Model Complexity (X-axis) to identify your core domains vs supporting/generic capabilities. This helps prioritize strategic investment and identify what should be core vs commodity.

![Distillation View](docs/context-flow-4.png)

### Strategic View
**Wardley mapping**: Shows the complete Wardley Map value chain with **Actors** (users of the map) → **User Needs** (problems to solve) → **Contexts** (solution components), all positioned along the evolution axis (Genesis → Custom-built → Product/Rental → Commodity/Utility). Analyze strategic positioning and dependencies.

Switch between views live. Same contexts, same relationships, same teams — different analytical models of your system.

## Why ContextFlow?

### Map reality, not aspiration

Most architecture diagrams show the system you wish you had. ContextFlow helps you map:
- Bounded contexts as they actually exist in your codebase
- DDD strategic patterns with upstream/downstream power dynamics
- Which teams own which repos, and where ownership is unclear
- Boundary integrity — because not all context boundaries are created equal

### Three models of your sociotechnical system

Each view is a different analytical model of the same bounded contexts, relationships, teams, and repos:

**Value Stream View** (context mapping) — Start here. Map contexts and how work flows through your system. Resonates with delivery teams and product owners: "Here's how value moves through our pipeline."

**Distillation View** (domain classification) — Classify your contexts. Use Nick Tune's Core Domain Chart to identify core vs supporting vs generic domains. Prioritize strategic investment: "What should we excel at vs what should we commoditize?"

**Strategic View** (Wardley mapping) — Complete the strategic picture. Position contexts on the evolution axis with actors and user needs. Resonates with leadership and architects: "Here's what's core vs commodity, where we're exposed, and what we should buy vs build."

All three views analyze the same system — different lenses, different strategic insights.

### Built for practitioners

- **Strategic View** for Wardley mapping with three-layer value chain structure:
  - Actors (users of the map) with connections to User Needs

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and opens the app in your browser.

The app includes multiple example projects:
- **ACME E-Commerce** — 20 contexts with external services (Stripe, shipping carriers, fraud detection) and realistic DDD relationship patterns (fictional data for demonstration)
- **cBioPortal** — Complete genomics platform with user needs value chain demonstrating actors → needs → contexts flow (adapted from public repository and documentation; does not reflect actual project realities)
- **Elan Extended Warranty** — DDD strategic patterns reference for teaching workshops (fictional data for demonstration)
- **Empty Project** — Practice template for your own context mapping

**Note:** All sample project data is invented for demonstration purposes, except cBioPortal which is adapted from the [public repository](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal) and documentation but does not represent the actual project structure or strategic decisions.

**Try it out:**
- Start in Value Stream View to map contexts and visualize flow
- Switch to Distillation View to classify contexts using the Core Domain Chart
- Move to Strategic View to add actors, user needs, and complete Wardley mapping
- Use the timeline slider to create keyframes and visualize temporal evolution
- Click a context to inspect and edit details
- Drag repos from the left sidebar onto contexts
- Multi-select contexts (Shift+click) and drag as a group
- Create relationships by dragging from one context to another
- Your changes sync to cloud automatically
