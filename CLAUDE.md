# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note**: This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking during AI coding sessions. Use `bd` commands for tactical work tracking. Human-readable roadmap remains in [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md). See AGENTS.md for workflow details.

## Quick Reference

For comprehensive documentation, see:
- **Product vision & goals**: [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)
- **Technical architecture & data model**: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **UX principles**: [docs/UX_GUIDELINES.md](docs/UX_GUIDELINES.md)
- **Getting started**: [README.md](README.md)

## Commands

```bash
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run dev     # Start local dev server
npm run build   # Build for production
npm test        # Run tests
```

## Local Collaboration Worker

Use a local worker when running integration tests or the app against a local collab server.

```bash
# In repo root (defaults to port 8787)
npx wrangler dev

# In another terminal, point the app to the local worker
VITE_COLLAB_HOST=localhost:8787 npm run dev
```

## Deployment

**Staging** (for testing before production):

```bash
VITE_COLLAB_HOST=contextflow-collab-staging.paul-162.workers.dev npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name contextflow-staging --branch main
```

**Production**:

```bash
VITE_COLLAB_HOST=contextflow-collab.paul-162.workers.dev npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name contextflow --branch main
```

The `VITE_COLLAB_HOST` environment variable is required at build time to configure which collaboration server the app connects to. Without it, the app defaults to `localhost:8787`.

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Code Organization
- **All types**: `src/model/types.ts` (single source of truth)
- **State management**: Zustand store in `src/model/store.ts`
- **Canvas**: React Flow patterns (custom nodes, edges, overlays)
- **UI components**: shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) + Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for view transitions

### Key Implementation Details

**Dual positioning system:**
Every BoundedContext has three position coordinates:
- `positions.flow.x` - horizontal position in Flow View
- `positions.strategic.x` - horizontal position in Strategic View
- `positions.shared.y` - vertical position (shared across both views)

**External contexts:**
- Cannot have repos assigned (`isExternal: true` blocks assignment)
- Show "External" badge and dotted ring visual treatment

**Undo/redo scope:**
- Applies only to structural canvas actions (add/move/delete context, add/delete relationship, assign/unassign repo, create/delete group)
- Text edits in InspectorPanel autosave directly and are NOT undoable

**DDD relationship patterns:**
Use fixed vocabulary from types.ts: `customer-supplier`, `conformist`, `anti-corruption-layer`, `open-host-service`, `published-language`, `shared-kernel`, `partnership`, `separate-ways`

**Groups (capability clusters):**
- Visual overlays only; deleting a group does not delete member contexts
- Can overlap (multiple groups covering same canvas area)

**InspectorPanel visibility:**
- When adding a new selectable entity type (e.g., relationship, flow stage), you MUST update `App.tsx` to include it in the conditional render
- Update BOTH `hasRightSidebar` calculation AND the conditional render `{(selectedContextId || selectedGroupId || ...) && <InspectorPanel />}`
- Common bug: Store updates correctly but InspectorPanel doesn't appear because App.tsx doesn't check the new selection state

**Tooltips:**
- Use `SimpleTooltip` for simple text tooltips (instant display, no delay)
- Use `InfoTooltip` for educational DDD concept tooltips (requires `ConceptDefinition` object, respects `showHelpTooltips` setting)
- NEVER use native `title` attribute (has browser-imposed delay)

### When Working on Features

1. Follow architectural patterns in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Match aesthetic guidelines in [docs/UX_GUIDELINES.md](docs/UX_GUIDELINES.md)
3. Preserve product vision and positioning from [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)

### Definition of Done (checklist before closing a feature)

- [ ] **Analytics coverage**: Verify the feature is tracked. New user-facing actions (buttons, toggles, dropdowns, entity CRUD) must fire analytics events. Check whether existing generic events (e.g., `context_updated` with `properties_changed`) already cover the new fields. If not, add explicit `trackEvent`/`trackPropertyChange` calls in `store.ts`. See `src/utils/analytics.ts` for helpers and `docs/ANALYTICS_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for conventions.
- [ ] **Yjs sync**: Any new entity field must round-trip through Yjs (types.ts, schema.ts, contextSync.ts, contextMutations.ts)
- [ ] **Tests pass**: `npm test` with no new failures

## Important Constraints

- **Browser-based**: works entirely in the browser with client-side storage; no backend required for core functionality
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked
