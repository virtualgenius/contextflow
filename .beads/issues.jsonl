{"id":"contextflow-y4d","title":"Audit and remove dead action functions superseded by collab mutations","description":"The store was refactored to use collab mutations (getCollabMutations()) but the old action functions in src/model/actions/ still exist with stale trackEvent calls. context_added, user_added, user_need_added events were silently dropped because the store methods were the real code path. Audit all action files (contextActions.ts, userActions.ts, etc.) to identify which functions are dead code vs still called, and remove the dead ones. Single source of truth should be the store methods.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"paul@virtualgenius.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T04:58:00Z","created_by":"Paul Rayner","updated_at":"2026-02-26T04:58:00Z"}
