{"id":"contextflow-q8e","title":"Bug: dragging contexts in Strategic/Distillation views does not auto-classify","description":"Moving a context in Strategic view should auto-update evolutionStage (genesis/custom-built/product/commodity) based on x position. Moving in Distillation view should auto-update strategicClassification (core/supporting/generic). The logic exists in contextActions.ts moveContextAction (lines 113-126) using classifyFromStrategicPosition and classifyFromDistillationPosition, but this is dead code. The store's updateContextPosition just calls getCollabMutations().updateContextPosition() with no classification. The distillation view has partial logic in setViewMode (runs on view switch only, not during drag). Fix: add auto-classification to the collab mutation code path, likely in updateContextPosition or as a post-drag handler similar to completeFlowStageMove.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"paul@virtualgenius.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T05:20:48Z","created_by":"Paul Rayner","updated_at":"2026-02-26T05:20:48Z"}
{"id":"contextflow-y4d","title":"Audit and remove dead action functions superseded by collab mutations","description":"The store was refactored to use collab mutations (getCollabMutations()) but the old action functions in src/model/actions/ still exist with stale trackEvent calls. context_added, user_added, user_need_added events were silently dropped because the store methods were the real code path. Audit all action files (contextActions.ts, userActions.ts, etc.) to identify which functions are dead code vs still called, and remove the dead ones. Single source of truth should be the store methods.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"paul@virtualgenius.com","created_at":"2026-02-26T04:58:00Z","created_by":"Paul Rayner","updated_at":"2026-02-26T04:58:00Z"}
