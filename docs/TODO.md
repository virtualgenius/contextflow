# TODO

## In Progress

- [ ] Research for SAAS cloud edition

## Backlog

### 0.9.0

- [ ] Bug - Add group didn't work for Leads Management. It added a group blob, but it is outside of leads management!
- [ ] Add new project description: goal/purpose, scope, creator name? created? last modified? (how does this match to Wardley Mapping step 1 - Purpose?)

### v.1.0.0 - SAAS cloud edition (users, auth, pricing)

- [ ] Implement milestone 1 of SAAS hosting (orgs & users etc) - SAAS_MONETIZATION_STRATEGY.md (for 1.0.0)
- [ ] Repo management
- [ ] Add about page? link to repo? link to VG.com
- [ ] Update virtualgenius.com with fresh images & licensing/pricing
- [ ] Add logo
- [ ] Susanne Kaiser feature ideas: flow overlays, blocker visualization, value stream types, team boundaries (see [Susanne_Kaiser_Feature_Ideas.md](Susanne_Kaiser_Feature_Ideas.md))

### Future

- [ ] Domain Roles / Model Traits — Brandolini's 15 bounded context archetypes (specification, execution, gateway, enforcer, etc.) as a field on contexts. Useful for workshops but 15 options is a lot of UI complexity. Consider after v1.0 when inspector UX is revisited. See docs/DDD_CREW_COMPARISON.md.
- [ ] Ubiquitous Language per context — term/definition pairs capturing context-specific vocabulary. Core DDD concept but needs a UX approach that doesn't clutter the inspector (canvas overlay? dedicated panel? linked view?). See docs/DDD_CREW_COMPARISON.md.
- [ ] Embeddable mode / facilitator dashboard — enable embedding multiple ContextFlow instances in a single page (iframe embed support) or Miro board, so a facilitator can watch multiple teams working on their context maps simultaneously in a class/workshop setting. May need CSP/X-Frame-Options changes, a compact embed mode, and/or a dedicated facilitator view with live thumbnails of multiple project rooms.
- [ ] Canvas mode / per-context deep dive view — inspired by the Bounded Context Canvas, a focused view for one selected context showing inbound/outbound communication, glossary, assumptions, etc. Complements the landscape views. See docs/DDD_CREW_COMPARISON.md.
- [ ] Hide context strategic classification and evolution stage values in inspector until explicity set in appropriate views?
- [ ] Enable contexts to be connected by top and bottom as well as the sides
- [ ] Check how shared kernel is represented (should probably be overlapping contexts?)
- [ ] Add optional user attributes: goal(s), challenges
- [ ] Distillation - can a context overlap subdomain boundaries? what would this tell us if it did?
- In ~/Documents/EventStormer, you enter your name when you join a board and then you can see other people's cursors with their names moving around on the board. Enable this for ContextFlow
- "Add Team" button in top menu?
- "Add Repo" button in top menu?
- Add Architecture for Flow example as sample? (get permission for this)

### Docs

- [ ] Update UX_GUIDELINES.md
- [ ] Update README.md with fresh images

### Temporal Evolution Enhancements

- [ ] Temporal Milestone 2: Interpolation polish (smooth animations, snap-to-keyframe refinements)
- [ ] Temporal Milestone 3: Keyframe Management UI (keyframe list panel, context visibility per keyframe, copy keyframe)
- [ ] Temporal Milestone 4: Visualization Enhancements (trajectory overlay, animated playback, ghost preview mode, quarter granularity)

### Team Topologies

- [ ] Enhance Team Topologies implementation with more substance (currently mostly conceptual)
- [ ] Add visual team topology rendering on canvas (e.g., interaction modes between teams)

### Integrations

- [ ] Import from a Big Picture EventStorming timeline (subprocesses between pivotal events as value stream stages, systems as contexts, actors as users, pivotal events as user needs? hotspots as issues?) exported from EventStormer (eventstormer.virtualgenius.com)
- [ ] Export to EventCatalog?
- [ ] Integrate glossary with Contextive?

### Team Flow

- [ ] Consider developing separate integrated tool for team flow (similar to CodeCohesion https://lnkd.in/grhy_XRp)

- [x] Revamp Getting Started Guide with approach selector (User Journey First vs Systems First), dedicated stages step with EventStorming context, and strategic views framed as DDD/Wardley Mapping lenses
- [x] Change "actor" -> "user" everywhere in the app where appropriate. This will make it consistent with Susanne's article and user needs mapping.
- [x] Add onboarding/tutorial for first-time users
- [x] Add grouping of elements and bulk-move
- [x] Context boundary width should more obviously reflect boundary strength (weak=dotted thin, external=dashed)

- [x] Fix overrunning of labels by relationship names
- [x] Should be able to select a Need->Context line. Should highlight similar to the actor-need line highlighting we just implemented (line and connected user need and context highlight)
- [x] Should be able to select and delete need->context line

- [x] Make huge node size YUGE (240x240 square dimensions)
- [x] Fix Delete key not working on Mac/Firefox (added onNodesDelete handler and deleteKeyCode=['Backspace', 'Delete'] to React Flow)

- [x] Update README to reflect new capabilities and language (v0.6.1: Value Stream View, actors/user needs, temporal evolution, multi-project support, CodeCohesion API, all example projects)
- [x] Consolidate duplicated test fixtures (extracted shared mockState, mockContext, mockGroup, mockRelationship, mockKeyframe builders; migrated contextActions, groupActions, relationshipActions, temporalActions, and actorActions tests; eliminated ~350-400 lines of duplication)
- [x] Break down addKeyframeAction into pure functions (likely already have unit tests in temporalActions.test.ts)
- [x] Make strategic classification boundaries not magic numbers everywhere
- [x] Export function from builtInProjects that indicates a project is builtin/sample that can be used from store.ts to replace "origin = 'sample'" logic
- [x] Refactoring should clean up redundant comments (e.g. // autosave <- like this, and this -> // Track analytics, and this -> // Track property changes)
